== Reverse Sentence

This problem is only a little harder than link:reverse-string.asciidoc[reverse string].
Here we must reverse just the words inside a string.
Each word is just a sequence of characters separated by spaces.

==== Insights

We can simply reuse the _reverse_ function from the previous problem and apply it to each word. 
The words are obtained by splitting the input on spaces.
After reversing we join everything back together.

==== IO and Examples

*_Arguments_*:

1. A string with words to be reversed

*_Return_*:

A string with every word reversed.

*_Example 1_*:

[source,python]

    assert reverse_sentence('If you reverse me I will reverse you!') == \
        'fI uoy esrever em I lliw esrever !uoy'
    

==== Python Solution

[source,python]
----
def reverse(s):
    return s[::-1]

def reverse_sentence(sen):
    return ' '.join([reverse(s) for s in sen.split(' ')])
